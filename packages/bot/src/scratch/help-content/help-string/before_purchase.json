        "After defining trade parameter and trade options, you may instruct your bot to purchase contracts when specific conditions are met. This can be done using logic and indicator blocks that help your bot to make decisions. A Bollinger Bans block is used in the example here to identify the trend, i.e. the direction market price may go."
